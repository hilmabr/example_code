museum.py
Final project in Intro to Python curse.
Lets user create and customize a museum database. Includes basic use of classes, data structures, searching, sorting, and file management.

picture.py
Simple tkinter picture using functions.

image_compression.m
Compresses an image using single value decomposition.

numerical_analysis
Contains a small excerpt from a project where we simulated a shock absorber consisting of two springs.
The main problem was to solve a system of differential equations and to study the effectiveness of different methods, including stability and order.
plotta_metoder.m plots the forward Euler method, the trapezoidal method, and ode45 (matlab function) next to each other.
Stabilitet.m shows how the forward Euler method behaves close to the maximum allowed step length for stability.
The other files contain the functions and quartercar.m contains the system.
